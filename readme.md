# Principal Component Analysis

The Principal Component Analysis is a Python program that allows users to find the most similar anime titles based on their synopses using cosine similarity. It uses a dataset with anime titles and their respective synopses to perform the similarity check.

## Usage
To use the program, first, download the scripts and the database and put them in the same folder. Then, execute the python script anime_synopsis_similarity_checker.py and follow the program instructions.
    
    'python principal_component_analysis.py'
    
Once the program is running, the user is prompted to enter the title of the anime they want to search for. If the title is found in the dataset, the program returns the synopsis of the anime and a list of the most similar anime titles based on their synopses.
